				<h4>What is MPR?</h4>
				<div>It stands for MooTools Plugin Repository and aims at helping developers to use and create MPR Plugins.</div>
				<h4>What is a MPR Plugin?</h4>
				<div>Basically it's a bunch of files named and ordered in a specific way so it can easil integrated. A typical MPR Plugin contains:
					<ul>
						<li>Javascript Files</li>
						<li>Documentation Files (Markdown)</li>
						<li>Demo Files</li>
						<li>Resources (Css, Images...)</li>
						<li>Specs</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<h4>Do I need a dokumentation for my MPR Plugin?</h4>
				<div>No, you don't need to add a doku but you should as it will help other and it's searchable.</div>
				<h4>Do I need a demo for my MPR Plugin?</h4>
				<div>No, but people really like demos. And it's really easy to learn from them.</div>
				<h4>Why should I publish my MooTools Plugin with MPR and not on my own?</h4>
				<div>I believe it's problematic that everyone is publishing in his own way as it's alwas different. Finding the nessesary CSS, JS, Image files is always hard. Furthermore the dokumentation and demos are
					always completely different and you need to bookmark (and find them if needed) seperately. With MPR everything is always in ONE place. You have the demos, the docs... in similiar manner and you can even
					search through all your locally installed plugins. And one of the best parts - Your Plugins can resists on other Plugins without the need to maintain the "original" Plugin. Once a Plugin is inside MPR
					you easily integrate it into your Plugin and you don't have to care about these dependences.
				</div>
				<h4>Howto install a MPR Plugin?</h4>
				<div>Installing a MPR Plugin is really easy. Just download a MPR Plugin as zip file and place it in "Mpr/MprZip/" [can be configured differently]. Then go to the MPR General Admin hit the install button and 
					you can explore the new demos/docus...
				</div>
				<h4>Howto create a MPR Plugin?</h4>
				<div>If you have a Plugin inside MPR you find this little icon beside it to download it - just distribute it instead of the single files. As a start you can look at the 
					<a href="MprAdmin.php?mode=demo&amp;file=./Snippets/MprDummyPlugin/Demos/MprDummyPlugin.html">MprDummyPlugin</a> or you can download it <a href="MprAdmin.php?mode=zip&amp;file=Snippets/MprDummyPlugin">directly as zip</a>.
				</div>
				<h4>Enough already - I wanna try it...</h4>
				<div>Just click on top at "Your Local MPR" - there you see what it will look like once you installed it at home... :p</div>
				<h4>Enough already - I wanna have it!</h4>
				<div>You can download the latest version at <a href="http://github.com/daKmoR/mpr/tree/master">github</a> where you can also get a zip file of it (click on the download button at the top).</div>
				<h4>Requirements</h4>
				<div>You need an server with php support. (no database)</div>
				<h4>More detail on the Installation</h4>
				<div>1) make it display something: download -> extract -> set rights (easiers: chmod 777 Mpr/MprCache Mpr/MprZip Mpr/MprIndex) [folders would be created automatically] <br />
				  2) use it: create a file called "USE_ADMIN_FUNCTIONS" in the root folder (it can/should be empt) [if you don't do this you can't use admin functions] <br />
					3) use the Search: General Admin -> Recreate Search Index
				</div>
				<h4>Change the Config</h4>
				<div>If you want to change something like the Zip/Cache or whatever path take a look at Mpr/Php/MprConfig.php for available options. Now create a MprConfig.php in the root folder and "override" what you want. 
					my "local" Config usually just resists of $MprOptions['useCache'] = false; so I can develop without cache.
				</div>
				<h4>I don't have PHP...</h4>
				<div>Well than a local installation of MPR won't work for you. But you can still use the convention for a MPR Plugin. Maybe we get some ports of MprJs.php and MprCss.php...</div>
				<h4>ok I got a MPR Plugin and I want to include it into the "offical" MPR</h4>
				<div>good to go :) Well there is currently no "Server" implementation where you could register and upload your plugins with commenting and bug reporting and so on... 
					However you can just post a zip at <a href="http://www.mooforum.net/general12/mpr-mootools-plugin-repository-t1543.html">mooforum.net</a> or <a href="mailto:at@delusionworld.com">send them to me</a> and I would be more than happy to integrate it into this current "demo".
				</div>
				<h4>Endnote</h4>
				<div>the "used" PHP code is far from beeing nice.. but hey it works and if you want to help to improve it - hell yeah I like teamwork... :p</div>
